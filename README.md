`rv32emu` is an instruction set architecture (ISA) emulator implementing the 32 bit [RISC-V processor model](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/).

## Build and Verify

`rv32emu` relies on some third-party packages to be fully usable and to provide you full
access to all of its features. Your target system must have a functional [SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/).
* macOS: `brew install sdl2`
* Ubuntu Linux / Debian: `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`

Build the emulator.
```shell
make
```

Run sample RV32I[M] programs:
```shell
make check
```

Run [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)), the classical video game, via `rv32emu`:
```shell
make doom
```

The build script will then download data file for Doom automatically.
When Doom is loaded and run, an SDL2-based window ought to appear.

If RV32F support is enabled (turned on by default), [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(series)) demo program can be launched via:
```shell
make quake
```

The usage and limitations of Doom and Quake demo are listed in [docs/demo.md](docs/demo.md).

## riscv-arch-test

The RISC-V Architectural Tests, also known as [riscv-arch-test](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test),
provides the fundamental set of tests that can be used to confirm that the behavior
of the risc-v model adheres to the RISC-V standards while executing certain
applications. (not intended to **replace thorough design verification**)

There are **reference signatures** that generated by the formal RISC-V model [RISC-V SAIL](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv)
in the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) files. ELF files that have multiple
testing instructions, data, and **signatures**, like `cadd-01.elf`. The specific data
places that must be written by the testing model (this emulator) throughout the test are
known as test signatures. The test signatures will be written after it has been completed,
and they will be compared to the reference signature. When both signatures exactly match,
the test is successful.

[RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) or [xPack GNU RISC-V Embedded GCC](https://xpack.github.io/riscv-none-elf-gcc/) should be prepared in advance. You can obtain prebuilt GNU toolchain for `riscv32-elf` via [Automated Nightly Release](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain/releases). Then, run the following command:
```shell
make arch-test
```

* To run the tests for specific extension, set the environmental variable `RISCV_DEVICE` to one of `I`,`M`,`C`,`Zifencei`,`privilege`.
```shell
make arch-test RISCV_DEVICE=I
```
* To run a specific test case,set both `RISCV_DEVICE` and `RISCV_TEST`.For example:
```shell
make arch-test RISCV_DEVICE=M RISCV_TEST=div-01
```
The details about the setup environment variables can be found in the [RISC-V Architectural Testing Framework](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test/blob/master/doc/README.adoc), **5.1 Setup environment variables**.

## Customization

`rv32emu` is configurable, and you can override the below variable(s) to fit your expectations:
* `ENABLE_EXT_M`: Standard Extension for Integer Multiplication and Division
* `ENABLE_EXT_A`: Standard Extension for Atomic Instructions
* `ENABLE_EXT_C`: Standard Extension for Compressed Instructions (RV32C.F excluded)
* `ENABLE_EXT_F`: Standard Extension for Single-Precision Floating Point Instructions
* `ENABLE_Zicsr`: Control and Status Register (CSR)
* `ENABLE_Zifencei`: Instruction-Fetch Fence
* `ENABLE_GDBSTUB` : GDB remote debugging support
* `ENABLE_SDL` : Experimental Display and Event System Calls

e.g., run `make ENABLE_EXT_F=0` for the build without floating-point support.

## GDB Remote Debugging

`rv32emu` is permitted to operate as gdbstub in an experimental manner since it supports
a limited number of [GDB Remote Serial Protocol](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Remote-Protocol.html) (GDBRSP).
You must first build the emulator and set `ENABLE_GDBSTUB` to `1` in the `Makefile` in order
to activate this feature. After that, you might execute it using the command below.
```shell
build/rv32emu --gdbstub <binary>
```

The `<binary>` should be the ELF file in RISC-V 32 bit format. Additionally, it is advised
that you compile programs with the `-g` option in order to produce debug information in
your ELF files.

You can run `riscv-gdb` if the emulator starts up correctly without an error. It takes two
GDB commands to connect to the emulator after giving GDB the supported architecture of the
emulator and any debugging symbols it may have.

```shell
$ riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb
(gdb) file <binary>
(gdb) target remote :1234
```

Congratulate yourself if `riscv-gdb` does not produce an error message. Now that the GDB
command line is available, you can communicate with `rv32emu`.

### Limitation

The development of `rv32emu`'s GDBRSP functionality is still ongoing. Due to the current
unfinished design, various restrictions on this feature are known.
* Since the 'G' packet is not supported yet, writing emulator registers with GDB is
not permitted.
* Consequently, the packets for binary download (the "X" packet) and memory writing
(the "M" packet) specified in GDBRSP are not allowed. It is forbidden to use GDB commands
such as "load" that aim to modify the emulator's internal memory.
* You can only set one breakpoint when debugging due to the inadequate breakpoint handling design.
