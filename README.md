# RISC-V RV32I[MAC] emulator with ELF support

`rv32emu` is an instruction set architecture (ISA) emulator implementing the 32 bit [RISC-V processor model](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/).

## Build and Verify

`rv32emu` relies on some 3rd party packages to be fully usable and to provide you full
access to all of its features. You need to have a working [SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/)
on your target system.
* macOS: `brew install sdl2`
* Ubuntu Linux / Debian: `sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`

Build the emulator.
```shell
make
```

Run sample RV32I[MA] programs:
```shell
make check
```

Run [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)), the classical video game, via `rv32emu`:
```shell
make doom
```

The build script will then download data file for Doom automatically. SDL2 based window should appear when Doom is loaded and executed. 

If RV32F support is enabled (turned on by default), [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(series)) demo program can be launched via:
```shell
make quake
```

The usage and limitations of Doom and Quake demo are listed in [docs/demo.md](docs/demo.md).

## riscv-arch-test

The RISC-V Architectural Tests, [riscv-arch-test](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test), is the basic set of tests that can ensure the risc-v model's behavior that matches RISC-V specifications while implementing specific software.(not a **substitute for rigorous design verification**)

There are **reference signatures** that generated by the formal RISC-V model [RISC-V SAIL](https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv) and the Executable and Linkable Format(`ELF`) files. The `ELF` files such as `cadd-01.elf` that contain several testing instructions, data, and **signatures**. The **test signatures** are the specific data locations that need to be written by testing model(this emulator) during the test. Once the test is executed, the **test signatures** will be written and compared to the **reference signature**. The test will pass if both signatures exactly match.

[RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) should be prepared in advance. You can obtain prebuilt GNU toolchain for `riscv32-elf` via [Automated Nightly Release](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain/releases). Then, run the following command:
```shell
make arch-test
```

* To run the tests for specific extension, set the environmental variable `RISCV_DEVICE` to one of `I`,`M`,`C`,`Zifencei`,`privilege`.
```shell
make arch-test RISCV_DEVICE=I
```
* To run a specific test case,set both `RISCV_DEVICE` and `RISCV_TEST`.For example:
```shell
make arch-test RISCV_DEVICE=M RISCV_TEST=div-01
```
The details about the setup environment variables can be found in the [RISC-V Architectural Testing Framework](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test/blob/master/doc/README.adoc), **5.1 Setup environment variables**.

            * `ebreak`
            * `ecall`
        + 5 misaligned CB-type instructions
            * `misalign-beq`
            * `misalign-bge`

            * `misalign-bltu`
        + 1 misaligned CL-type instructions
            * `misalign-lw`
        + 1 misaligned CS-type instructions
            * `misalign-sw`

## Customization

`rv32emu` is configurable, and you can modify `Makefile` to fit your expectations:
* `ENABLE_RV32M`: Standard Extension for Integer Multiplication and Division
* `ENABLE_RV32A`: Standard Extension for Atomic Instructions
* `ENABLE_RV32C`: Standard Extension for Compressed Instructions (RV32C.F excluded)
* `Zicsr`: Control and Status Register (CSR)
* `Zifencei`: Instruction-Fetch Fence

Add `-D` to enable and `-U` to disable the specific ISA extensions.
