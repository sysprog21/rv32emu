 * sanitize_path returns the shortest path name equivalent to path
 * by purely lexical processing. It applies the following rules
 * iteratively until no further processing can be done:
 *
 *  1. Replace multiple slashes with a single slash.
 *  2. Eliminate each . path name element (the current directory).
 *  3. Eliminate each inner .. path name element (the parent directory)
 *     along with the non-.. element that precedes it.
 *  4. Eliminate .. elements that begin a rooted path:
 *     that is, replace "/.." by "/" at the beginning of a path.
 *
 * The returned path ends in a slash only if it is the root "/".
 *
 * If the result of this process is an empty string, Clean
 * returns the string ".".
 *

 * Getting Dot-Dot Right,”
