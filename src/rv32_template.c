/* RV32I Base Instruction Set */
/* conforming to the instructions specified in chapter 2 of the unprivileged
 * specification version 20191213.
 */

/* This file establishes a low-level instruction execution abstraction layer,
 * crucial for both the interpreter's instruction dispatching and the
 * execution of native functions written to memory. The JIT compiler currently
 * supports only x86-64 (x64) and Aarch64 (Arm64) architectures, which
 * simplifies the process due to their abundant registers and register-based
 * calling conventions. It effectively navigates the limitations associated
 * with self-modifying code.
 *
 * To accommodate the specific needs of these platforms, a highly selective
 * approach in practices and design is adopted. The file is designed as a
 * foundational template for code generation in both the interpreter and JIT
 * contexts. To facilitate this, a domain-specific language (DSL) is utilized,
 * augmented by a C macro named 'RVOP'. Furthermore, a Python script is employed
 * to convert code templates efficiently, enabling automatic generation of the
 * JIT code generator and thus eliminating the need for repetitive manual
 * coding.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * RVOP(
 *   addi,
 *   { rv->X[ir->rd] = (int32_t) (rv->X[ir->rs1]) + ir->imm; },
 *   GEN({
 *       rald, VR0, rs1;
 *       map, VR1, rd;
 *       cond, regneq;
 *       mov, VR0, VR1;
 *       end;
 *       alu32imm, 32, 0x81, 0, VR1, imm;
 *   }))
 *
 * VR0, VR1, VR2 are host registers for storing calculated value
 * during execution. TMP are host registers for storing temporary calculated
 * value or memory address during execution. The block defined as 'GEN' is
 * mapped to the generic C code used in the interpreter. The following
 * instructions will be generated by JIT compiler:
 * - Load X->rs1 (target field) from the rv data structure to VR0
 * (destination register), if X->rs1 has been loaded to the host register, the
 * host register number would be assigned to VR0.
 * - Map the host register to VM register X->rd.
 * - Move the register value of VR0 (X->rs1) into VR1 (X->rd) if the
 * VR0 (X->rs1) is not equal to VR1 (X->rd).
 * - Add imm to VR1 (X->rd)
 *
 * The sequence of host instructions generated during dynamic binary translation
 * for the addi instruction:
 *     mov VR0, [memory address of (rv->X + rs1)]
 *     mov VR1, VR0
 *     add VR1, imm
 *
 * The parameter of x64 or arm64 instruction API
 * - size: size of data
 * - op: opcode
 * - src: source register
 * - dst: destination register
 * - pc: program counter
 *
 * Here is the mnemonic listing for the DSL.
